This project showcases the power of GPT-2, a pre-trained language model developed by OpenAI, to generate human-like text based on a given prompt.

Key Features:
Utilizes GPT-2 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Accepts a custom text prompt as input.

Generates fluent and coherent text continuations.

Easily configurable parameters like max length, temperature, and top-k sampling to control creativity and randomness.

Use Cases:
Creative writing (stories, poetry)

Prompt-based content generation

Auto-completion and dialogue generation

This project demonstrates how modern NLP models can understand context and generate meaningful text outputs that mimic human language.
